# WeatherAPI-Application
- Made with HTML, CSS and Javascript
- The user will see two city buttons, each with the name of a city: Toronto, and a second city of your choosing.
- Clicking on one of the buttons will reveal the hidden output section.
- This section will provide the current weather data for the selected city by using 
- AJAX to fetch the OpenWeatherMap Current Weather Data API. Output to the 
# Appropriate areas of the webpage will be:
-  The name of the selected city
-  The current temperature (in Celsius, with text to indicate °C)
-  The current weather conditions
-  The API icon that represents the current weather conditions
-  Added contextual text or adjust the raw data to make it user friendly. E.g. in step 2 above, I added °C to the text.
- Clicking on either button will update the output section with the current weather data for the selected city.
